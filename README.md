**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

- Begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that your server will manage.

## Getting Started

- Do a formal code review of each person’s code (10 minutes each).
  Open your partner’s GitHub pull request on your laptop.
  Identify an area in the code that:
  you don’t understand
  or seams overly complex
  or you see a way to improve
  or you want more information on
  or you really like or think is interesting
  Add kind comments or questions inline using the GitHub review feature.
